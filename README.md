# FinerF5
A simple [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) mod that provides more refined control to your perspective switching
## Description
+ I made this mod to address the disorientation I feel when doing a quick perspective switching to peek and the game goes through the third perspective(front) essentially reversing the control, especially when on motive, which kind of makes me dizzy.
+ For now, six functions have been added to the control.
  - Toggle between 1st & 3rd back (default: `F6`)
  - Toggle between 1st & 3rd front (default: `F7`)
  - Toggle between 3rd back & front (default: `None`)
  - Switch to 1st (default: `None`)
  - Switch to 3rd back (default: `None`)
  - Switch to 3rd front (default: `None`)
  > Note: The toggle button will always switch to the primary perspective if not in any two modes can be toggled between, e.g. when you use the 1st & 3rd back toggle and you are in the 3rd front, you will be switched to 1st perspective.
## Demo
+ 1st & 3rd back toggle

+ 3rd back & front toggle

## Future plan
+ Add a fancy perspective selector similar to game mode selector, for fun
+ Backport if required
